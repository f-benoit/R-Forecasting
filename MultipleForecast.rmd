## Time Series with Week Seasonal periods
This chunk of code forecasts the futur 36 weeks sales for each depot present in my data
* Create an empty dataframe
* for each depotname (in my  vector depot) run the forecasting process
* if there's less than 150 weeks historic I don't forecast anything
* remove 12 weeks of my historic data and keep them in my testing dataframe
* tun the forecasting function stlf on my trianingset all historic weeks-12
* store the result of the sales forecatsing for the enxt 36 weeks
* repeat the operation for each depot
* merge all my data together forecasted data, original historic sales and original budget data
* export them into a csv file
